## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed before proceeding:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**  
- **Eclipse IDE** with the following plugins:
  - **EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework)**  
  - **Xtext** for language engineering  
  - **Xtend** for textual modeling

## Assignments

### Assignment 1
**Topic:** Variability and Features in Software Product Lines.  

**Focus:** Analyze features, variability, and possible extensions in a given software project.  

**Tasks:** Describe current features and variability mechanisms. Suggest extensions and generalizations.  

---

### Assignment 2
**Topic:** Metamodel.  

**Focus:** Design and implement a **metamodel** that represents core concepts and relationships within the chosen system.   

**Tasks:** Implement grammar rules, constraints, and syntax validation.  

---

## Project
**Topic:** Domain-Specific Languages (DSL).

**Focus:** Develop an **Ecore Metamodel** defining the domain concepts and generate the corresponding **Java code** for the metamodel.  

**Tasks:** Add non-trivial constraints and derived features, provide example model instances to showcase variability points, and demonstrate variability handling with configurable instances.
